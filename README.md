# Savings-Tracker
As a college student, i constantly found myself in debt. 
I created this program to help keep track of my finances.
It contain three accounts types: SAVING, CHECKING, and BUSINESS
It also has a single randomly generated routing number and three different account numbers.
The user can transfer between accounts. 
Negative balances are allowed but a warning is given when the user falls in the redzone
